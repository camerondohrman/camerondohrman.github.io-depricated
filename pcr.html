                  I am a veritable warehouse superhero. In two weeks over winter
                  break I took on the personal projects of two other
                  supervisors: repairing registers, writing reviews, training
                  new supervisors, and bailing out the food court when they fell
                  behind on pizza orders. With a thank you and a fat handshake
                  from my manager, I left the warehouse to resume my studies.

                  I visited a handful of tables at the WWU All Industries Career
                  Fair. I worked on my elevator pitch in real time, discovering
                  that it is more difficult to make eye contact with HR
                  professionals than it is with myself in the mirror. My attempt
                  to start a friendly rivalry between the oil drilling company
                  and the solar panel company did not seem to entertain either
                  party. Tough crowd.

                  I've always been a little dubious about online social
                  networks, but it has been entertaining and enlightening to see
                  how my classmates and coworkers present themselves online. I
                  even got in touch with an old mentor of mine who I haven't
                  checked in with in many years.

                  As part of the onboarding process for Costco supervisors we
                  take a four hour training course titled "Drawing the Line"
                  which goes over a variety of ethically questionable scenarios
                  and how they can be dealt with in a human and professional
                  manner. The solutions are all common sense, but it is still
                  important to spell it out so that ethical behavior is second
                  nature.

                  Romeo and Jules was a mainstage play put on by the University
                  of Washington while I was a student there. In collaboration
                  with the Trans* advocacy groups on campus, the School of Drama
                  wrote a script following the plot of Shakespeare's Romeo and
                  Juliet but including several non-binary characters and
                  conflicts unique to their identity. I played the role of
                  Tybalt, which required a new level of emotional intelligence
                  to do justice to the material. It is the single performance I
                  am most proud of.

                  This course on organizational behavior all led up to a class
                  presentation pitching a new business idea. My idea was a
                  medieval themed family friendly restaurant with a bar and
                  arcade. Not especially original, but the entertaining part was
                  that the management of this fictional company was organized
                  like a feudal dutchy, complete with a Chancellor, Spymaster,
                  Marshal, and Chaplain. We brought costumes and a lot of dark
                  age humor to the presentation. We had the class rolling in
                  laughter, and got straight A's as a bonus.
